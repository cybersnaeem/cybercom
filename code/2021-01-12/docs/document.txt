Todays Points That I have Learn
================================
 
first i have practice on "arrays in javascript" in that i have learn methods related to an array.

    - push()
        -it will store the value in array(at the last position of an array)..

    - pop()
        -it will pop out (delete) the value from an array(from the last position of an array..)

    - unshift()
        - it will store the value in array(at the first position of an array)..

    - shift()
        -it will pop out (delete) the value from an array(from the first position of an array..)


after that i have understand the concept of global execution..

    where i have learn that our each task like if we define any function it will store in global execution stack..
    after the completion of each function the function is popped out from the global exection stack..

Hoisting..
===========

In Hoisting concept we can call the function before defining it.

    example:. Find Out Age and Retirement..

        // in case of function declaration it will work
            --->possible
            getAge(1998)
            function getAge(age){
                var d = new Date();
                var currentAge = d.getFullYear()-age;
                console.log('Current Age is: ' + currentAge);
                return currentAge;
            }

In case of function expression.. we cannot call the function before defining it.

        // in case of function expression it will not work
            ---> not possible 
                retirementDate(60);
            var retirementDate = function retirement(retDateYear){
                
                var retire =  retDateYear - getAge(1998); 
                console.log('you will be retire after '+retire + ' years');
                return retire;
            }

today there is not any practices are given thats why im done some practice by my own
