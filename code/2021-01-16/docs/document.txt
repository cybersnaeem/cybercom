-> i have done practice on first class function means that function calls inside the function 


->another topic i have learn that how function return function..

    you can call the function inside function by two ways..

        -> 1. example;;

            var variable1 = function1(argument1)

            variable1(argument2)

        -> 2. example;;

            function1(argumant1)(argument2)

            so.. function1 return function and that 2nd function will generate the output..

-> data privacy using IIFE(Immediately Invoke Function Expression)


-> i have done the practice which is ask for.

    Question : based on the job title display their name and interview question...(using closure..);
