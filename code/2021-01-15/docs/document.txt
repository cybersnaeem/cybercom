-> today i learn some events in javascript

->after that i have learn some basic style using basic bootstrap which i applied in coding challenge 3.

-> after that i have learn some basic concept like creating an object , how to use inheritance in js..

-> uses of prototype chain 

-> difference between function constructor and object.create();

    1. function constructure:
        here we have to use prototype method with the constructure for initialize values..

    2. object.Create():
        here we need pass 1st argument as a prototype..

-> after that i have learn about the difference between the primitive vs objects..
