first i read the concept of branch from the git and github branches 

after that i have created one repository named as branch branch practice 

where i created different different branches named as follow:

	- codebranch
	- documentbranch
	- practice 

steps i follow today::
=======================

-first i have created one repository named "branchpractice"

- i have create one folder inside my directory.. and open in visual studio code

- aftet i have created three branches in my repository by using following commands..

	-git checkout -b codebranch
	-git checkout -b documentbranch
	-git checkout -b practice

- after that i have created two files in my local project named as index.html and index.js file

- after that i switching my branch from main to codebranch where i store all my code files which i created
named index.js and index.html

	commands:-
	==========
		-git add *.html (using this command you can store all the html extension file in repo)
		-git add *.js
		-git checkout codebranch
		-git commit -m "upload only js file in code branch"
		-git push origin codebranch

	this will store your js and html file in "codebranch" branch of practicebranch repository


- after that i have created one file in my local project named 2021-01-06.txt inside "docs" folder

- after that i switching my branch from codebranch to documentbranch where i store all my code files which i created
named doc folder

	
	commands:-
	==========
		-git add docs/2021-01-06.txt
		-git checkout documentbranch(switch from codebranch)
		-git commit -m "add docs folder in documentbranch"
		-git push origin documentbranch

	this will store your docs containig file in "documentbranch" branch of practicebranch repository

- after that i have created one file in my local project named cmds.txt inside "practice" folder

- after that i switching my branch from documentbranch to "practice" branch where i store all my all comands that i perform today.
in practise branch
	
	commands:-
	==========
		-git add practice/cmds.txt
		-git checkout practice(switch from documentbranch)
		-git commit -m "add practice folder and commands text within it"
		-git push origin practice

	this will store your docs containig file in "practice" branch of practicebranch repository



-If you want to remove branch then you need to use following command..

	command:
	=========
		- git branch -d (for delete) <NameOfTheBranch>

if you want to navigate from one branch to another then we have two diffecrent commands..


	command:
	========
	 	- git checkout -b <branchName>
		- git switch <branchName>(already have a branch) or git switch -c <branchName>(create new branch)
